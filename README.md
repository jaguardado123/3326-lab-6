# Lab Assignment 05

In this lab you will practice working with Comparison & Boolean operators.

Same as the previous labs, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the `src/` directory and name your class accordingly and remember to make it `public`. Next, **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

### Comparison and Boolean Operators

Exactly the same as C++. But let's refresh anyways. 

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two literal values (or variables) and return a Boolean value. This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

| Operator | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| `==` | Equal to |
| `!=` | Not equal |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `<` | Less than |
| `>=` | Greather than or equal to |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to |

### Boolean/Logical Operators

You can also compare Boolean (true or false) values using logical operators. Logical operators are useful when dealing with multiple comparisons.

| Operator | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| `&&` | AND - Returns true if both statements are true. |
| ll | OR - Returns true if at least one statement is true. |
| `!` | NOT - Reverses the result. |

## Your Assignment

### Comparison Operators Practice

For this lab assignment I want you to practice working with comparison and Boolean/logical operators. 

Create your own example for **each comparison and Booelan operator** in a print method.

**Example:**
```java
// Example for == operator.
System.out.println(" 'A' == 'a' : " + ('A' == 'a'));
```

## Submit your assignment

To submit your lab assignment click on the **Source Control** icon (3 circles with 2 lines) on your leftside navbar. Next, click on the **+** symbol next to **Changes** to stage your changes. Lastly, add a commit message (ex: "First commit") and click **Commit** then **Sync Changes**. And you're done!
