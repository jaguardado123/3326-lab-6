# Lab Assignment 05

In this lab you will practice working with Comparison & Boolean operators.

Same as the previous labs, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the src/ directory and name your class accordingly and remember to make it **public**. Next, **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

## Comparison and Boolean Operators

Exactly the same as C++. But let's refresh anyways. 

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either true or false.

| Operator | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greather than or equal to |
| <= | Less than or equal to |

### Boolean/Logical Operators

You can also test for true or false values with logical operators. Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

| Operator | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| && | AND - Returns true if both statements are true. |
| ll | OR - Returns true if at least one statement is true. |
| ! | NOT - Reverses the result. |

## Your program

**Comparison Operators Practice**

For this lab assignment I want you to practice working with comparison and Boolean/logical operators. 

Give an example of **each** operator in a print() method.

**Example:**
```java
// Example for == operator.
System.out.println(" 'A' == 'a' : " + ('A' == 'a'));

// Example for && operator.
System.out.println(" 10 > 5 && false : " + (10 > 5 && false));
```

## Submit your assignment

To submit your lab assignment click on the source control icon (3 circles with 2 lines) on your leftside navbar. Next, click on the '+' symbol next to "Changes" to stage your changes. Lastly, add a commit message (ex: "First commit") and click "Commit" then "Push" or "Sync Changes". And you're done!
